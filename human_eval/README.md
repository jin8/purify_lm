# Human Evaluation

We have provided the input files and results files of our human evaluation (with WorkerID dropped). For sentiment evaluation, we updated PPLM hyperparameters after the submission version (to improve PPLM performance), and redid comparisons between PPLM and DExperts. Thus the sentiment files combine results from two different batches.
